# Rock, Paper, Scissors

## Deliverable

Fork this repository. Your final solution should be in your master
branch.

## Instructions

### Create the game

Build the RPSGame class according to the Rspec tests.

### Create the app

Integrate your RPSGame class with the Sinatra application in app.rb.

The game will be played by modifying the URL to specify your play (rock,
paper, or scissors).

The Sinatra application should serve a page that displays the move that the
player made, the move that the computer made, and whether the player
won, lost, or tied.
