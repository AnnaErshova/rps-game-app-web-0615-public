# Rock, Paper, Scissors - Part 1 - Models

## Deliverable

Fork this repository. Your solution should be delivered in your master branch.

## Instructions

### Create the game model

Build the RPSGame model according to the rspec tests.

### Create the Sinatra app

Integrate your RPSGame class with the Sinatra application in app.rb.

The application will serve 1 route: GET requests to  the path /rps/:play.
The value of :play will be used as the player's throw (rock, paper, or
scissors). 

The Sinatra application should serve an HTML page that displays the move that
the player made, the move that the computer made, and whether the player won,
lost, or tied. 

# Rock, Paper, Scissors - Part 2 - Persistence

## Deliverable

Work in your existing repository. Your solution should be delivered in your master branch.

## Instructions

### Get the tests to pass

Create an RPSGameResults model backed by Sequel and get the tests passing.

Use a migration and run it manually.

### Update the Sinatra application

You should move your require statements into your
config/environment.rb file. Your config.ru should like this:

```ruby
  require './config/environment'

  run GameApp
```

Change your application to have 4 routes:

GET /rps_game_result/:id
GET /rps_game_results
POST /rps_game
GET /rps_game

GET /rps_game page should render a form that provides the RPS choices
with a radio button element.

Submitting the form should send POST /rps_game. The POST /rps_game should
store the result of the game in a table called "rps_game_results", which has
the following columns:

* play - the player's play
* computer_play - the computer's play
* won - true if the player won, false if not
* tied - true if their was a tie, false if not
* created_at - approximately when the game results were calculated

Install the Sequel gem to manage your database using Bundler
(that means having a Gemfile!). Use a migration to create your table.

Refactor your existing RpsGame class to be a Sequel::Model that is
backed by the rps_games table.
